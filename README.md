# Facial Emotion Recognition with Recommendation System

## Overview

This project aims to develop a Facial Emotion Recognition system that identifies the emotional state of users through their facial expressions and provides personalized recommendations based on the detected emotions. The system utilizes machine learning models for emotion detection and a recommendation engine to suggest relevant content.

## Features

- Real-time facial emotion detection
- Emotion classification into categories such as happy, sad, angry, surprised, etc.
- Personalized recommendations based on detected emotions
- Interactive user interface

- pip (Python package installer)

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/facial-emotion-recognition.git
    cd facial-emotion-recognition
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

## Usage

### Starting the Backend Server

1. Navigate to the root directory of the project.
2. Start the backend server:

    ```sh
    python app.py
    ```

### Starting the Frontend Server

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
2. Start the frontend server:

    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Model Training

To train the emotion recognition model, you can use a dataset like [FER-2013](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deadskull7/fer2013). Place the dataset in the `data` directory and run the training script:

```sh
python train_model.py
